# Hackathon sample template - Capture an image for image recognition using Azure Computer Vision

This repo provides a template for a Python/Flask app that streams images from the users webcam to a video player on an HTML page. Then when the use clicks a button, it will capture the image and POST it to a route in the Flask app. This route will send the image to the Azure Computer Vision service for image recognition.

## To use this repo

* Select the **Use this template** button at the top of the page. This will create a new GitHub repo in your account using the code from here as the basic template.
* Clone the new repo
* Open it in [Visual Studio Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/?WT.mc_id=academic-0000-jabenn). You will need the [Python extension](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/itemdetails?itemName=ms-python.python&WT.mc_id=academic-0000-jabenn) installed in Visual Studio Code.
* Open the terminal and install the pip packages from the `requirements.txt` file:

  ```sh
  pip3 install requirements.txt
  ```

## Running the app

THe app will contain configuration to allow you to debug it as a Flask app from inside Visual Studio Code.

## The structure of the code

* `app.py` - this file contains the Flask app. It has two routes:
  * `/` - this loads the `home.html` template, passing in an empty dictionary of data
  * `/process_image` - this receives the image as a JSON document containing the image as Base64 encoded data.

## Adding the Computer Vision service

* If you don't already have an Azure account, you will need to create one:

  * Students can sign up at [aka.ms/FreeStudentAzure](https://azure.microsoft.com/free/students/?WT.mc_id=academic-0000-jabenn) using a valid higher education email address. You won't need a credit card and will get US$100 to use for 12 months, as well as 12 months of free services. After 12 months if you are still a student you can renew for another 12 months and get another $100 and free services, and so on each year you are still a student.

  * If you are not a student you can sign up at [aka.ms/FreeAz](https://azure.microsoft.com/free/?WT.mc_id=academic-0000-jabenn). You will need a credit card to verify you are not a bot (you won't be charged anything), and wil get US$200 for 30 days, as well as 12 months of free services.

You can create a Computer Vision resource from either the Azure portal, or the Azure CLI.

### Create a Computer Vision resource from the Azure portal

* Open the Azure Portal from [portal.azure.com](https://portal.azure.com/?WT.mc_id=academic-0000-jabenn). Log in if required.

* Select *Create a resource* or select the green plus button.

* Search for *Computer Vision*
  
  ![Searching for Computer Vision in the Azure Portal](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/jimbobbennett/TemplateImages/master/CreateNewComputerVisionResource.png)

* Select *Computer Vision*, then select the **Create** button.

* Enter the required details:
  * Give this a name.

  * Select the Azure Subscription you want to use.

  * Choose a location to run this code. Azure has 'regions' all around the world, a region being a group of data centers full of computers and other cloud hardware. Choose a region closest to you.

  * Select the pricing tier. With this app, you will make less than 20 calls a minute, and less than 5,000 calls a month, so select *F0*, the free tier. There is a paid tier for apps that need to use the service more often.

    > You can only have one free tier of each Azure Service, so if you have already created a free tier Computer Vision resource before you will either need to use a paid tier, or connect to the existing resource.

  * Select the resource group you want to run the code in. If you don't have one you want to use, create a new one.

  * Select the **Create** button.

  ![The create computer vision blade in Azure](https://github.com/jimbobbennett/TemplateImages/blob/master/CreateNewComputerVisionResourceDetailsBlade.png?raw=true)

* The Computer Vision resource will be created. You will be notified when done. Select **Go to resource** from the popup, or the notification pane.

* From the resource, head to the *Quick Start* tab. Take a note of the *Key1* and *Endpoint* as you will need these later.

### Create a Computer Vision resource from the Azure CLI

* Ensure you have the [Azure CLI](https://docs.microsoft.com/cli/azure/install-azure-cli/?WT.mc_id=academic-0000-jabenn) installed

* Log in to your azure account

  ```sh
  az login
  ```

* Get a list of all Azure regions to find the one closest to you

  ```sh
  az account list-locations \
    --query "[].{Region:name}" \
    --out table
  ```

* If you don't already have a resource group to create the resource in, create one

  ```sh
  az group create \
    --name <resource-group-name> \
    --location <location>
  ```

  Replace `<resource-group-name>` with the name for your resource group, and `<location>` with the closest location to you from the list output by the last command

* Create the Computer Vision resource

  ```sh
  az cognitiveservices account create \
    --name <resource-name> \
    --resource-group <resource-group-name> \
    --kind ComputerVision \
    --sku F0 \
    --location <location> \
    --yes
  ```

  Replace `<resource-name>` with a name for your Computer Vision resource. Replace `<resource-group-name>` with the name for your resource group, and `<location>` with the closest location to you.

  > This creates a free tier resource, which gives you 20 calls per minute and 5,000 per month. If you want to use a different tier, replace `--sku F0` with a different sku, such as `S0`. See the [pricing docs](https://azure.microsoft.com/pricing/details/cognitive-services/computer-vision/?WT.mc_id=academic-0000-jabenn) for more details.

* The output of this command will contain and endpoint, so take a note of this value as you will need it later.

* Get the key

  ```sh
  az cognitiveservices account keys list \
    --resource-group <resource-group-name> \
    --name <resource-name>
  ```

  Replace `<resource-name>` with a name for your Computer Vision resource, and `<resource-group-name>` with the name for your resource group.

  This will return two keys. You will only need one of these keys later, so take a note of one value.

### Configure the code

* Add a file called `.env` to the app to store application keys. Add key/value pairs for the endpoint and API key

  ```sh
  computer_vision_endpoint=<endpoint>
  computer_vision_key=<key>
  ```

  Replace `<endpoint>` with the endpoint you noted down earlier. Replace `<key>` with the key you noted down earlier. These values will be used to create the Computer Vision client in the code

* There is code in the `/process_image` route to send the captured image to the Computer Vision service and return a detected image description, which is then shown on the web page. Replace this code, and the following comment with your code to use the different Computer Vision services such as image descriptions, image categories, object detection or text detection:

  ```python
  ######################################################
  #                                                   #
  # Add your code here to use the Computer Vision SDK #
  #                                                   #
  #####################################################
  ```

To see the range of capabilities of the Computer Vision service, check out the [QuickStarts in the Cognitive Services docs](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/cognitive-services/Computer-vision/quickstarts-sdk/python-sdk/?WT.mc_id=academic-0000-jabenn).

## Deploying to Azure

Once your app is complete, you can deploy it to an [Azure App Service](https://azure.microsoft.com/services/app-service/?WT.mc_id=academic-0000-jabenn). There is an [Azure App Service extension for Visual Studio Code](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/itemdetails?itemName=ms-azuretools.vscode-azureappservice&WT.mc_id=academic-0000-jabenn) that you can use to allow you to deploy from inside Visual Studio Code.

> Deploying apps from VS Code is not recommended for production apps, but is great for development or a hackathon

* Open the command palette:
  * On Windows, press Ctrl+Shift+P
  * On MacOS, press Cmd+Shift+P

* Select *Azure App Service: Deploy to Web App...*
  
  ![The command palette showing the Azure App Service: Deploy to Web App option](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/jimbobbennett/happysadangryworkshop/master/images/CommandPaletteDeployAppService.png)

* You will be asked what code you want to deploy. This option will automatically select the folder with your code in it, so select that.

  ![The command palette showing the deployment source option](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/jimbobbennett/happysadangryworkshop/master/images/SelectDeployFolder.png)

* If you have never signed into Azure from Visual Studio Code before, you will be asked to sign in.
  * Select *Sign in to Azure...*
  * Your browser will be launched, and you can sign in with your Azure account.
  * Once signed in from the browser, you can close the web page that was launched.

* Select the Azure subscription you want to use.
  
  ![The command palette showing the select subscription option](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/jimbobbennett/happysadangryworkshop/master/images/SelectDeploySubscription.png)

* Select *+ Create New Web App*

  There are 2 *Create New Web App* options, one marked as *Advanced*. You want the normal one, **not** the *Advanced* one.

  ![The command palette showing the create web app option](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/jimbobbennett/happysadangryworkshop/master/images/CreateNewWebApp.png)

* Give your web app a name. This will be part of the public web site address, so needs to be unique across the world. For example, I might use `jimspythonwebapp2019`.

  ![The command palette showing the new web app name option](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/jimbobbennett/happysadangryworkshop/master/images/SelectWebAppName.png)

* Select the runtime for your App Service App. This is a Python app, so select the latest version of the Python runtime, such as *Python 3.7*

  ![The command palette showing the select runtime option](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/jimbobbennett/happysadangryworkshop/master/images/SelectPythonRuntime.png)

* The App Service will start being created. You will see a progress bar on the bottom right, and this will show you once it is complete. You can monitor the progress from the *Output* window by selecting *View -> Output* and selecting *Azure App Service* from the window selector..

  ![The create app service progress bar](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/jimbobbennett/happysadangryworkshop/master/images/CreateWebAppProgress.png)

* Some popups wil appear asking if you want to make configuration changes to speed up deployment and always deploy this web app. Select **Yes** for both.
  
  ![The update workspace configuration dialog](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/jimbobbennett/happysadangryworkshop/master/images/UpdateWorkspaceConfigDialog.png)
  
  ![The always deploy to the web app configuration dialog](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/jimbobbennett/happysadangryworkshop/master/images/AlwaysDeployDialog.png)

* A popup will appear showing the deployment progress. You can monitor the progress from the *Output* window by selecting *View -> Output* and selecting *Azure App Service* from the window selector.
  
  ![The deploy progress dialog](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/jimbobbennett/happysadangryworkshop/master/images/DeployProgress.png)

* Once the code has been deployed, you will be able to view the code over the internet. Launch your browser and open your web site. The address will be `https://<web app name>.azurewebsites.net/`. For example, for my web site this is `https://jimspythonwebapp2019.azurewebsites.net/`.

> These steps will create a Free tier App Service and deploy your app to it. You can only have one Free tier per subscription, so if you have already got a free app service running, use the *Create New Wep App Advanced* option, and create using a paid tier.
